Description: Bindings for the 'PicoSAT' solver to solve Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT).
             The boolean satisfiability problem asks the question if a given boolean formula can be TRUE; 
             i.e. does there exist an assignment of TRUE/FALSE for each variable such that the whole formula is TRUE?
             The package bundles 'PicoSAT' solver release 965 <http://www.fmv.jku.at/picosat/>.
